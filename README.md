Image Classification - Face and Digit

Training and Testing data Set for face - ./facedata
Training and Testing data Set for digit - ./digitdata

Algorithm Implementation files:  
Naive Bayes: ./naiveBayes.py 
Perceptron: ./perceptron.py 
k Nearest Neighbor: ./kNearestNeighbors.py

Report and analysis docs: ./Report, ./Graph, ./Results

Steps to Run the Classifiers:
1. Open PowerShell and Navigate to ImageClassification folder
2. Execute PowerShell script run.ps1 and below prompt will come:

Choose the classification algorithm: 
N:naiveBayes, 
P:Perceptron, 
K:KNearestNeighbors, 
A:All

Choose epochs/iterations:: 

Select the classifier algorithm to run and epoch value for same.
The run.sh script which automatically generates the result files for both face/data and for each algorithm, which later is used for graph plot and analysis.
